# SDGI_TEAM5_Major_Project_Road_Traffic_Accident_Analysis

Road Traffic Accident Analysis using various labels like State-Wise , Year-Wise , Lanes , Time of Day , Weather , Vehicle Type , Reasons for Accidents etc are used

Our Analysis depicts most common factors and their impact on high number of road accidents

#Our Implementation :

Datasets used:


    DF - Analysing Accidents per Lakh Population-State-Year.
    DF1 - Analysing Offender and Victim Deaths per Gender, State.
    DF2 - Analysing Deaths occured due to improper use of Safety Accessories.
    DF3 - Analysing rate of accidents from the year 2013 to 2016 for each state.
    DF4 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths occuring as per number of lanes.
    DF5 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths occuring due to various faults/reasons.
    DF6 - Analysing accidents/injuries/deaths as per the types of vehicles.
    DF7 - Analysing number of accidents which take place as per time of occurence.

Libraries and modules Used:
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) Matplotlib
4) Seaborn
5) Scikitlearn
6) CSV	
7) xlrd
8) math

Mostly our analysis utilizes:
i) pandas dataframes for reading csv , xlsx data sets and splitting and organizing data too
ii) We used matplotlib for visualizing data in form of piecharts and line graphs
iii)similarly we also employed seaborn for better visualization
iv)sklearn(scikit-learn) enhances our analysis
V) math module helps in performing basic mathematical computations etc
 


# This project helps to government , traffic police and in general public and everyone who wants to utilize it so that, percentage of accidents minimizes
